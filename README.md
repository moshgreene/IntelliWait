# IntelliWait
IntelliWait is a utility that waits on a tree of processes. It is like the Windows command line "Start /wait" but better. It waits on a process and any child processes.

### ProcStart
ProcStart is a utility that was initially created to test IntelliWait. But it turned out to be pretty useful.

ProcStart can clone itself, or you can use it to launch other applications and get their exit code.
